I am a postdoc at Cancer Registry of Norway, Oslo. My research interests include RNA sequencing, early detection of cancer (e.g. lung, colorectal) and RNA-RNA interactions.

I did my PhD (Biotechnology/Bioinformatics) at University of Canterbury, New Zealand. I was working on non-coding RNA interactions in prokaryotes. My PhD thesis focused on ncRNA-mRNA interactions in prokaryotic genomes (bacteria and archaea).
